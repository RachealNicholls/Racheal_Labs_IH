    "# Lab | Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming lab! This lab is designed to help you apply the concepts you have learned about object-oriented programming in Python. Through a series of programming exercises, you will learn how to use classes, objects, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way of modeling real-world objects as software objects. By using OOP, you can reduce the complexity of code and make it more robust, maintainable, and scalable, saving time and effort in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, many data analytics tools and libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, use OOP concepts, and it is essential for data analysts to understand these concepts to be able to use these tools effectively. OOP can also help data analysts to create custom data structures and algorithms that are tailored to their specific needs, which can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab consists of a series of programming exercises that will guide you through the process of building different applications using object-oriented programming concepts. You will start by defining classes and objects, and then you will learn how to use inheritance to create more complex programs. You will also practice encapsulation, which is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary functionality."

This can be useful for various purposes, such as generating unique account numbers or monitoring the growth of a bank's customer base.*"
